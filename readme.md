#War of the Wasps

Romford has been invaded by space wasps. Wasps are an untrustworthy and disgusting race, and your job as ace pilot Ken Dagless is to ice as many jaspers as you can before the queen wasp humps the kiddie wing of Romford General Hospital. And some of the kids have whooping cough.

Based on a concept from 'Man to man with Dean Learner' by Matt Holness and Richard Ayoade
